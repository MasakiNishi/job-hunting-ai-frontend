### Project Description:

In the modern job market, finding the right job can be a daunting task, especially for students and
new job seekers. Our project aims to simplify this process by developing an intelligent job search
website powered by AI and machine learning, guided by a series of questions from the user.
What sets our project apart is its dual focus on providing highly personalized job
recommendations and leveraging advanced data analytics to understand and predict job market
trends. By combining web scraping, APIs, text mining, and machine learning, we aim to create a
platform that not only matches users with relevant job opportunities, but also provides insights
into the factors that influence job success.

Our platform is designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers by offering a
seamless, data-driven job search experience. Through user-friendly interfaces and powerful
backend analytics, we aspire to make job searching more efficient and effective. Whether it's
understanding the correlation between certain skills and job availability or predicting the best
locations for specific job roles, our project is geared towards making informed job searching a
reality.
